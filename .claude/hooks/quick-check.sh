# Fast static checks only: no full test suite, no browser, no network.
# jq-free by design (a stock Git Bash has no jq; a hook that crashes on missing
# jq fails open on every call). It does not parse stdin at all.

# Exit contract (PostToolUse): the tool has ALREADY run, so nothing here can
# block it. Exit 2 = surface stderr to the model as feedback ("fix as you go");
# exit 0 = silence. Verified on Claude Code 2.1.193 (Win + Git Bash) — see
# harness/README.md; re-confirm on your version.
